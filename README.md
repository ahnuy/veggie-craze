# Veggie Craze

## Description

*Veggie Craze* is a game based off the classical game, *Whack-A-Mole*. The objective of the game is to dig up as many vegetables as you can within the time limit before the veggie bunny takes them, which varies on the difficulty. 

Using a virtual shovel and your computer mouse, right-clicking allows you to dig up the vegetable. Each vegetable has a different type and location. Carrots add 5 points while beets add 25 points. Turnips can add an extra 3 seconds to the clock. However, if the user digs up a flower, they lose 5 seconds as they have caused damage to the environment. 

The difficulty affects the amount of time the user gets each game, maximum number of vegetables that are allowed to pop up at a time and how frequently they disappear from the screen (or how frequently the veggie bunny steals the vegetables). 

The game reaches its end when the user runs out of time. Their final score is displayed and then they have the choice to play again, or quit. 

## Instructions

You can begin the game by opening the file “Veggie Craze.py” and running it. Once open, you can jump right into the game by clicking the “play” button. Instructions will be written under the button. The game begins to count down and lets you prepare for 3 seconds and get into a comfortable position. 

Using your mouse you can right-click on the vegetables to dig them out of the ground. The carrots will give you 5 points, beets give 25 points and turnips add a 3 second time bonus. Avoid the flowers as they deduct 5 seconds. 

The game is over when you run out of time. Try to dig as many vegetables as possible in the time limit! When the game ends, you can choose to play again by pressing “r” or “q” to quit.
